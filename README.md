# How to use
In line 4 change the file name to test any image "img = cv2.imread('2check.jpg')". Replace the "2check.jpg" with your own file or one of the many files in the existing project. The file should be in the same place of the script or if you choose to keep it in a seperate folder do specify the folder path in line 4.

# Save file
An additional file is saved in the same directory of the script when the program is run.
